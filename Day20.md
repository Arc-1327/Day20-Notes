# Data Visualization
* Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. 
* Uses visual elements like charts, graphs, maps, and data visualization tools.
* Provides an accessible way to analyze and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

# Matplotlib
* Matplotlib is an open-source Python library that allows users to create static and interactive plots.
* Data visualization using Matplotlib creates graphical representations of data, making it easier to understand and visualize.
* It can create  line plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, etc.
* Matplotlib works well with NumPy, Pandas, and other Python libraries making it better for data visualization.

* The steps used for Data Visualization using Matplotlib include:
  - Import Matplotlib: import the matplotlib.pyplot module.
  - Prepare Data: define the input data to be visualized.
  - Create the Plot: use appropriate Matplotlib functions to generate the plot.
  - Customize the Plot by adding titles, labels, legends, etc.
  - Display the plot: use plt.show() to display the visualization.
* Types of Data Visualization techniques using Matplotlib:
  - Line Graph, Bar Chart,

# Feature Engineering
## Feature Orthogonality:
* Two features are said to be orthogonal if they are independent and have zero correlation.
* Ensuring orthogonality helps to prevent redundancy and multicollinearity, which leads to more stable and interpretable models.
* Cosine Similarity: method to evaluate the similarity between two vectors using the cosine of the angle between them.

## Feature Collinearity:
* When two or more features are highly correlated, it results in redundancy.
* Too much similarity can confuse models, making them harder to train and less accurate.
* So when two functions are collinear, the least important function is neglected.

## Feature Slicing:
* It is the method of dividing data based on a specific feature to analyze or process data independently.
* It finds patterns in specific groups and helps improve accuracy.
* Often used for exploratory data analysis.

## Indicator Variable:
* A binary variable that is used to indicate the presence or absence of a certain condition, category, etc.
* Helps models handle missing data or categorical features.

## Feature Binning:
* Method of grouping continuous numbers into ranges called Bins.
* All bins have the same range and an equal number of data points.
* It reduces noise and outliers, allowing models to treat continuous data as categorical.

## Mathematical Transfor,s:
* Logarithms:
  - Used for reducing tailedness or skewness.
  - Compares larger values to the smaller ones.
  - Cannot handle zero or negative values.
  
* Fourier Transform(FTT):
  - Decomposes a signal into its frequency components.
  - It analyzes time-series data to extract patterns.

* Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT):
  - Version of FFT that analyzes time-varying frequency components by applying FFT.
  - Also tracks how patterns change over time.
